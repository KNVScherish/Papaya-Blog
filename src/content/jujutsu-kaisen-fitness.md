excerpt: Reading Manga and lifting weight.

So I have started lifting wieght and and also started to get back into reading manag of new series and I want to combine these two as a way to track my progress and talk about any 
and all projects I may be working while going on my fitness journey. Last week I worked on Back and chest and arms. I probably wont post my detailed logs but instead post my Samsung Helath from my watch.
I just want to make it clear that I didn't start to lift and go to gym at the rate I am going now to reach a certain fitness goal. I started doing this to rebuild my sense of discipline tat I once had prevously.
I was once a volunteer Firefighter and I was once 165 Lbs and 9% body fat and this was done with with the consistency that I had when when I was trying to join the military. 

I just wnated to get back into my flow of consistency and use it to get back into it.

I am starting this blog to keep track of my progress and get back into the hobbies that I had before.

Just running into the the first post of the week I will preface each post with my workout from the previous week and then talk about the manga I have been reading and then journal down my thoughts
and reaffirm my goals for the future as well as posting my general diet for the week.
